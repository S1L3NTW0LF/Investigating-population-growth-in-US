Is a Udacity Project. (Datasets were provided to be chosen from.) 

The project does a simple analysis on three different factors that could affect population growth. Those three factors are the population of the state, the percent of foreign born individuals, and the median household income. The data is from the 2016 US Census. 

## Data Cleaning
1. transposed dataframe 
2. appropriate rows and columns are dropped 
3. columns are renamed 
4. datatypes are changed from object to numeric datatype 

## EDA
1. look over summary statistics for each column 
2. look at frequency distribution for each column 
3. create scatterplots for each column to see relationship with population % change

## Conclusions 
1. weak to no correlation between any of the columns 
2. strongest correlation to population % change looked related to foreign born population 

## Limitations of Analysis 
1. did not take into account population density
2. did not take into account differences in households when looking at median household income
